                Research and research groups play a crucial role in the academic landscape of our school. They provide a platform for faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, and students to engage in cutting-edge investigations, contribute to knowledge creation, and address real-world challenges. These research groups are often organized around specific disciplines, themes, or areas of expertise, allowing researchers to collaborate and exchange ideas within their respective fields. Research groups provide a supportive environment for mentorship, fostering the growth of young researchers and enabling them to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. Additionally, these groups often collaborate with external partners, industry professionals, and other academic institutions, leading to interdisciplinary research projects and the dissemination of research findings through conferences, publications, and exhibitions. By promoting a culture of innovation, inquiry, and collaboration, research groups in schools contribute to the advancement of knowledge, enrich the learning experience, and create opportunities for students and researchers to make meaningful contributions to their fields of study.
